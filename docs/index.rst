While there are many tools and languages available to simply analyse structured data, there is nothing comparable for unstructured data. One reason for that is, that this data is unpredictable and may change overtime. The goal of this Bachelor Thesis is to develop a tool to help simplify analysing unstructured data over time.

This results in the new tool named CyberCaptain, as it allows the developer to cruse on the data the internet provides. It drastically cuts down the complexity to develop new analysis and works with much less code, which reduces the possibilities for bugs to occur drastically.
